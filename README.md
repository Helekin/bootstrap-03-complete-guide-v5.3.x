## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- To get started, make sure you have any code editor installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Helekin/bootstrap-03-complete-guide-v5.3.x.git
```

### Usage

To customize any of these websites, you need to install Node.js and run the following in the project folder:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install Bootstrap, Sass and Font Awesome. To build your CSS files from Sass, run:

```sh
npm run sass:build
```

To watch your Sass files for changes, run:

```sh
npm run sass:watch
```

For custom stying, use the `scss/styles.scss` file.

To customize Bootstrap, you can add Bootstrap variables to the `scss/bootstrap.scss` file. You can look at the file `node_modules/bootstrap/dist/scss/_variables.scss` for a list of all the variables. Do NOT edit the `variables.scss` file directly, as it will be overwritten when you update Bootstrap.
